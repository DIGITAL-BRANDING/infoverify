/**
 * Fixes a real bug: an AdminJS record action's `redirectUrl` (returned from
 * its `handler`) is followed with React Router's client-side `navigate()`
 * (see node_modules/adminjs/lib/frontend/hooks/use-action/
 * use-action-response-handler.js) - i.e. it only works for paths AdminJS's
 * OWN React Router knows about (/admin/resources/..., /admin/pages/...).
 * Our custom server-rendered pages (/admin/cac/:id/manage,
 * /admin/nin-modification/:id/pdf, etc - plain Express routes, not part of
 * the AdminJS SPA at all) don't exist in that router, so `navigate()`
 * silently falls through to AdminJS's own catch-all and lands on the
 * dashboard - which is exactly the "Manage" button redirecting to the
 * dashboard" bug this fixes.
 *
 * The fix: give the action THIS component (instead of `component: false` +
 * a `redirectUrl`), and have it perform a real `window.location.href`
 * assignment on mount. That's a genuine full-page browser navigation, which
 * (unlike React Router's navigate()) happily leaves the SPA and loads
 * whatever the target URL actually serves - the same way the plain
 * `<a href="...">` dashboard tiles in components/dashboard.tsx already
 * work for the other custom pages (Company Wallet, Bulk Pricing, etc), just
 * triggered from an action button instead of a dashboard tile.
